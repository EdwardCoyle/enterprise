## Important Notes

It's important to keep in mind that CSS utilities are meant to be small, reusable classes that can be quickly applied to HTML elements to achieve a specific style or behavior.

## Behavior Guidelines

CSS Utilities are pre-defined classes that you can add to HTML elements to quickly apply certain styles or behaviors to them. The CSS utilities listed provide a set of useful classes that can save a lot of time and effort when styling components or web pages. Below is a detailed documentation of each of the utilities:
