## Code Example

The Action Sheet HTML markup is generated by the component, after the component is invoked against its trigger button.  Actions are defined in Javascript as a simple array of objects.

```html
<button id="action-sheet-trigger" class="btn-icon">
  <span class="audible">Trigger Action Sheet</span>
  <svg role="presentation" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon">
    <use href="#icon-more"></use>
  </svg>
</button>
```

Each action is defined by its "icon" and "text" properties:

```js
$('#action-sheet-trigger').actionsheet({
  actions: [
    { icon: 'mail', text: 'Email' },
    { icon: 'user-profile', text: 'Go to Profile' },
    { icon: 'workflow', text: 'Share' },
    { icon: 'user-status-do-not-disturb', text: 'Remove' }
  ]
});
```

### Responding to Actions

The action sheet accepts a callback for the following situations:

- When a selection occurs, via an `onSelect` callback.
- When the Action Sheet is cancelled, via an `onCancel` callback.

These callbacks can be defined via the settings.  The callbacks can contain corresponding UI elements that triggred the action/cancel:

```js
$('#action-sheet-trigger').actionsheet({
  actions: [ /* ... */ ],
  onSelect: ($a) => {
    console.info(`UI that was selected: ${$a.text().trim()}`);
  },
  onCancel: ($a) => {
    console.info(`UI that was responsible for cancelling: ${$a.text().trim()}`);
  }
});
```

### Changing Breakpoints

The breakpoint in which the Mobile view is displayed can be configured.  Using
